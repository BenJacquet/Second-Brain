		- Self-healing
		- Auto scaling
	- Compute:
		- Cluster of DB instance across multiple AZs
		- Auto scaling of Read replicas
	- Cluster:
		- Custom endpoints for reader and writer DB instances
- Same security as RDS

- Features:
	- Aurora Serverless:

	- Aurora Multi-Master:
		- For continuous write failovers (high write availability)
	- Aurora Global:
		-  Up to 16 DB Read instance in each region
