## Holistic, integrated and standardized approach
KM should not be interpreted as a one-sided technology, culture, coordination, leadership or reorganization problem.
On the contrary, all these components as well as the relationships and interdependencies between them have to be considered in order to turn potentials into profits.

## Knowledge-oriented culture
A supportive organizational culture is one of the most important factors for a successful KM initiative. An open and communicative atmosphere can thrust the sharing of knowledge, the identification, creation and acquisition of new knowledge by employees.

## Management support
As in all efforts of organizational change, it is important that top management sets strategic knowledge goals, allocates sufficient budgets to the initiative and gives a good example for the change of behavior required to improve the handling of knowledge.

## Clear economic benefits
The establishment of a “knowledge controlling” is required that coordinates goal setting (planning) and goal assessment, e.g., on the basis of the intellectual capital approach in order to show that a KM initiative really is worth the investment.

## Exact vision and language
Terms such as knowledge, information, learning, knowledge base or organizational learning are subject to interpretation.
A KM initiative should define these terms with respect to the organization’s knowledge related goals so that the perspective on what is and what is not knowledge management is clearly communicable within the organization.

## Effective aids for motivation
Incentive systems have to be installed that reward an improvement of the organizational knowledge base.

## Appropriate process orientation
The integration of KM activities into the organization’s business processes is an important factor as an effective and efficient handling of knowledge requires it being part of the organization’s daily routine.

## ICT and organizational infrastructure
ICT can be the enabling factor in a KM initiative. There are also limits to its use and the installation of a good platform does not guarantee success.
A good organizational infrastructure is regularly connected with a separate organizational unit or position that coordinates the initiative.

## Stable knowledge structures
Knowledge structures (ontologies) are required to enable participants to search and navigate the abundance of (documented) organizational knowledge.
Successful KM initiatives thus require a well-documented, stable knowledge structure.

## Redundant channels for knowledge transfer
The transfer of redundant knowledge with the help of several channels supports the learning process.
New communication channels introduced with KMS should not be seen as replacements for existing channels, but as aids to improve the effective and efficient use of the existing channels.

## Continuous participation of employees
As with the implementation of most organizational and ICT instruments, participation of employees helps that the solutions are well received by the employees so that motivation to cooperatively use the new ICT and organizational instruments is high.
