### Generalization
Before sharing knowledge with a larger group, it's essential to generalize individual experiences into lessons learned, like identifying influencing factors and aggregating similar experiences to create best practices. When using Knowledge Management Systems, the level of generalization must be considered, as more specific knowledge requires more context for the seeker to understand, learn, and reuse the information.

**Context relevance**. Business processes can provide part of the context that is important for the interpretation and construction of process-relevant knowledge. This includes knowledge about business processes that is to be linked with knowl- edge derived from processes during their operation.
