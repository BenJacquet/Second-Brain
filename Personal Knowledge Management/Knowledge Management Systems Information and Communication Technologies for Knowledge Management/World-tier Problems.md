In the book, we can determine some problems that make knowledge management solutions necessary for organizations across the globe:

### Co-evolution of society, organization, products, services, work and workers
Generally, there is more and more knowledge required for individuals in order to (actively) participate in the knowledge society.

### Globalization of businesses
Complex alterations of organizational structures and the blurring of organizational boundaries are the results of organizational activities in the globalizing economy.

### Fragmentation of knowledge
Knowledge is spread over numerous experts, among organizational units, across organizations and does not stop at national borders. Researchers have to cooperate worldwide in order to stay competitive, especially in dynamic fields such as bio-technology, computer science or telecommunications.

### Need for speed and cycle-time reduction
It is necessary to increase the speed at which the organizationâ€™s environment is scanned for opportunities and threats and to increase the speed at which knowledge flows into an organization and at which knowledge is created and distributed to those organizational members who need it.

### Need for organizational growth
Growth requires a stronger emphasis on innovation and the development of new markets.

### Complex organizational interlacing
It is now preferable for organizations to create alliances that allow them to share complementary competencies.
