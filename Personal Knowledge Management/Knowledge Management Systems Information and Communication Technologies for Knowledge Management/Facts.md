Around 60% of the gross national product in the USA is based on information, opposed to physical goods.

Development process of new products or services can take up to 80% or 90% of the production cost.

There was a shift, as knowledge workers now replace industrial workers as the biggest workforce portion.

In the beginning of the twenty-first century, it is no longer natural resources (especially oil) that creates money, but knowledge.

Today, for the first time in history, the worldâ€™s wealthiest persons, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, etc, are knowledge workers.

Knowledge work requires that knowledge is continuously revised, and considered permanently improvable, not as truth, but as a resource.

The transformation of work and workers into knowledge work and knowledge workers is at the core of a larger shift at the organizational and at the societal level. Intelligent organizations have to provide a context supportive of knowledge workers and their needs in that they excel in the combination of individual expertise into organizational core competencies.

On the societal level which provides both, the infrastructure (e.g., communication networks) and the suprastructure (e.g., the regulatory environment) for organizations, there is a strong move towards a general scientification of work and organizations.
This is not only true for traditional professional work (e.g., medical doctors, lawyers, scientists), but also for all kinds of sectors and areas which were not considered knowledge-intensive before.

Generally, there is more and more knowledge required for individuals in order to (actively) participate in the knowledge society.

Knowledge is spread over numerous experts, among organizational units, across organizations and does not stop at national borders. Researchers have to cooperate worldwide in order to stay competitive, especially in dynamic fields such as bio-technology, computer science or telecommunications.
