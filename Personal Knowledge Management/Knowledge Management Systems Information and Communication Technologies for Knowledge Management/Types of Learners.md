- Innovators: these are the most aggressive learners who effectively combine internal and external learning,
- Loners: are the ineffective (or isolated) learners. They are slow in applying new knowledge, have a narrow knowledge base and their external linkage is lower than that of all the others,
- Exploiters: spend the lowest amount on R&D, have a broad knowledge base, a high level of external linkage and focus external rather than internal learning,
- Explorers: put much emphasis on fast, radical learning. As compared to innovators, explorers spend less on R&D and have a lower focus on external learning.


A comparison of the financial performance of the four groups revealed a ten- dency for the innovators and explorers to be more profitable than the exploiters and the loners.
