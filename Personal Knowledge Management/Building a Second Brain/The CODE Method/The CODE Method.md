## The Four Steps to Remembering What Matters

They are exible and agnostic for any profession, role, or career and for whatever notetaking methods and platforms you prefer.

### Capture: Keep What Resonates

When something resonates, it moves you on an intuitive level.

Often, the ideas that resonate are the ones that are most unusual, counterintuitive, interesting, or potentially useful.

Don’t make it an analytical decision, and don’t worry about why exactly it resonates—just look inside for a feeling of pleasure, curiosity, wonder, or excitement, and **let that be your signal for when it’s time to capture** a passage, an image, a quote, or a fact.

By training ourselves to notice when something resonates with us, we can improve not only our ability to take better notes, but also our understanding of ourselves and what makes us tick.
It is a way of turning up the volume on our intuition so we can hear the wisdom it offers us.

Instead of jumping at every new notication, we can choose to consume information that we value and let go of the rest.

### Organize: Save for Actionability

Because our priorities and goals can change at a moment’s notice, and probably will, we want to avoid organizing methods that are overly rigid and prescriptive.

The best way to organize your notes is to **organize for action**, according to the active projects you are working on right now.

Consider new information in terms of its utility, asking, “How is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects?”

Organizing for action gives you a sense of tremendous clarity, because you know that everything you’re keeping actually has a purpose.
You know that it aligns with your goals and priorities.

**Instead of organizing being an obstacle to your productivity, it becomes a contributor to it.**


### Distill: Find the Essence

Once you start capturing ideas in a central place and organizing them for action, you’ll inevitably begin to notice patterns and connections between them.

There is a powerful way to facilitate and speed up this process of rapid association: **distill your notes down to their essence**.

Every idea has an “essence”: the heart and soul of what it is trying to communicate.
It might take hundreds of pages and thousands of words to fully explain a complex insight, but there is always a way to convey the core message in just a sentence or two.

**You are giving your future self the gift of knowledge that is easy to find and understand.**

### Express: Show Your Work

What is the point of knowledge if it doesn’t help anyone or produce anything?

A common challenge for people who are curious and love to learn is that we can fall into the habit of continuously force-feeding ourselves more and more information, but never actually take the next step and apply it.

Creating new things is not only one of the most deeply fulfilling things we can do, it can also have a positive impact on others—by inspiring, entertaining, or educating them.

**Shift as much of your time and effort as possible from consuming to creating.**
