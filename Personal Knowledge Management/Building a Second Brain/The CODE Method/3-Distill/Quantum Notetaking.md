# How to Create Notes for an Unknown Future

When you first capture them, your notes are like unfinished pieces of raw material. They require a bit more refinement to turn them into truly valuable knowledge assets, like a chemist distilling only the purest compound.

This is why we separate capturing and organizing from the subsequent steps:
You need to be able to store something quickly and save any future renement for later.

**Notetaking is like time travel, you are sending packets of knowledge through time to your future self.**

You probably consume a lot of books, articles, videos, and social media posts full of interesting insights, but what are the chances that you’ll be ready to put any given piece of advice into action right at that instant?

By doing so, you will sometimes have your mind blown by this invaluable information.

A few hours, days or weeks pass by and that exciting new idea is nothing but a pale shadow of something we once knew.

**That way your excitement and enthusiasm for your knowledge builds over time instead of fading away.**
