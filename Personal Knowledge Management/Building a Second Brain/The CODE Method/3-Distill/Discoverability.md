# The Missing Link in Making Notes Useful

The most important factor in whether your notes can survive that journey into the future is their discoverability: how easy it is to discover what they contain and access the specic points that are most immediately useful.

Librarians think about discoverability when deciding how to lay out books on the shelves.
Web designers think about it when they create menus for the websites you visit every day.

Your future self might have mere minutes before a meeting starts to quickly search their notes for a reference they need.

In that sense, each note is like a product you are creating for the benefit of that future customer.

**If they don’t buy it—they don’t think it’s worth the effort of revisiting past notes—then all the value of the work you’re doing now will be lost.**

Distillation is at the very heart of all effective communication.

The more important it is that your audience hear and take action on your message, the more distilled that message needs to be.

**The details and subtleties can come later once you have your audience’s attention.**
