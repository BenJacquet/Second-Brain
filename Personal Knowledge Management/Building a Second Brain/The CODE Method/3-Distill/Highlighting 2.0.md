# The Progressive Summarization Technique

It is a simple process of taking the raw notes you’ve captured and organized and distilling them into usable material that can directly inform a current project.

The technique is simple: you highlight the main points of a note, and then highlight the main points of those highlights, and so on, distilling the essence of a note in several “layers.”
Each of these layers uses a different kind of formatting so you can easily tell them apart.

Here are the four layers of Progressive Summarization:

## 1. Captured Notes

As interesting as this content is, it’s not nearly succinct enough.
**Too much volume to effectively discover the key points.**

## 2. Highlighted Passages

This will often amount to just one or two sentences that encapsulate the message of the original source.
**All the key points are highlighted and allow for faster search through the note.**

## 3. Bolded Passages

Bold the main points within the note.
This could include keywords linked to what this text is about, phrases that capture the author message, or sentences that resonated with you.
**I’ll be able to decide in the blink of an eye whether this source is relevant to my needs.**

## 4. Executive Summary

A fourth layer is needed when you find yourself visiting a note again and again, clearly indicating that it is one of the cornerstones of your thinking.

Use few bullet points to encourage yourself to make this executive summary succinct.

**I can rapidly recall the main takeaways from this article in a fraction of the time it would take to reread the original.**
