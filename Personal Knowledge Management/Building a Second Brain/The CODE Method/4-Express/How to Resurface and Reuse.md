There are four methods for retrieval that overlap and complement one another. Together they are more powerful than any computer yet more flexible than any human mind. You can step through them in order until you find what you’re looking for:

## 1. Search

Search has the benefit of costing almost nothing in terms of time and effort.
Search should be the first retrieval method you turn to, it is most useful when you already know more or less what you’re looking for.

## 2. Browsing

Browsing allows us to gradually home in on the information we are looking for, starting with the general and getting more and more specific.

## 3. Tags 

Tags are like small labels you can apply to certain notes regardless of where they are located. Once they are tagged, you can perform a search and see all those notes together in one place.

## 4. Serendipity

Don’t begin and end your search with only the specific folder that matches your criteria. Make sure to look through related categories, such as similar projects, relevant areas, and different kinds of resources.
