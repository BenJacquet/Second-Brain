# How to Protect Your Most Precious Resource

The ability to intentionally and strategically allocate our attention is a competitive advantage in a distracted world. We have to jealously guard it like a valuable treasure.

Because we manage most of our “work-in-process” in our head, as soon as we finish the project and step away from our desks, all that valuable knowledge we worked so hard to acquire dissolves from our memory like a sandcastle washed away by the ocean waves.

If we consider how precious little time we have to produce something extraordinary in our careers, it becomes imperative that we recycle that knowledge back into a system where it can become useful again.

The final stage of the creative process, **Express**, is about refusing to wait until you have everything perfectly ready before you share what you know.

It is about expressing your ideas earlier, more frequently, and in smaller chunks to test what works and gather feedback from others.

That feedback in turn gets drawn in to your Second Brain, where it becomes the starting point for the next iteration of your work.
