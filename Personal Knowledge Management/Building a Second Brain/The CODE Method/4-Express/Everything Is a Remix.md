Borrow aspects or parts of their work, these are like the ingredients you put in a blender before hitting the button and mixing it into your own recipe.

As the potential of your intellectual assets becomes apparent, you’ll start to look for any way to spend your time creating such assets and avoid one-off tasks whenever possible.

You will start to seek out ways of acquiring or outsourcing the creation of these assets to others, instead of assuming you have to build them all yourself.
These changes will enable you to get things done at a pace that is far beyond what mere “productivity tips” can ever achieve.

Your assets are like the neurons in an intelligent organism that is growing, evolving, reaching for higher levels of consciousness with each new experience it has.
