# The Secret to Frictionless Output

While you can sit down to purposefully create an IP, it is far more powerful to simply notice the IPs that you have already produced and then to take an extra moment to save them in your Second Brain.

Your Second Brain is the repository of things you are already creating and using anyway.

Once weâ€™ve completed these initial steps, expression transforms from a gut- wrenching, agonizing feat to a straightforward assembly of existing packets of work.

Over time, your ability to quickly tap these creative assets and combine them into something new will make all the difference in your career trajectory, business growth, and even quality of life.
