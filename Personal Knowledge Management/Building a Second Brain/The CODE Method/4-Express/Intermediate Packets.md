# The Power of Thinking Small

If you’re stuck on a task, break it down into smaller steps.

Here’s what most people miss: it’s not enough to simply divide tasks into smaller pieces—you then need a system for managing those pieces.
Otherwise, you’re just creating a lot of extra work for yourself trying to keep track of them.

Any note can potentially be used as an Intermediate Packet in some larger project or goal.

Like LEGO blocks, the more pieces you have, the easier it is to build something interesting. Imagine that instead of starting your next project with a blank slate, you started with a set of building blocks that represent your long-term effort to make sense of your field.

There are five kinds of **Intermediate Packets** you can create and reuse in your work:
- **Distilled notes**: Books or articles you’ve read and distilled
- **Outtakes**: The material or ideas that didn’t make it into a past project but could be used in future ones.
- **Work-in-process**: The documents, graphics, agendas, or plans you produced during past projects.
- **Final deliverables**: Concrete pieces of work you’ve delivered as part of past projects, which could become components of something new.
- **Documents created by others**: Knowledge assets created by people on your team, contractors or consultants, or even clients or customers, that you can reference and incorporate into your work

Using **Intermediate Packets** provide very powerful benefits:
- You become less vulnerable to interruptions, because you’re not trying to manage all the work-in-process in your head.
- Big projects and goals become less intimidating because you can just keep breaking them down into smaller and smaller pieces, until they t right into the gaps in your day.
- You craft just one small building block at a time and get outside input before moving forward.
- Eventually you’ll have so many **IP**s at your disposal that you can execute entire projects just by assembling previously created **IP**s.

**The idea of starting anything from scratch will become foreign to you**.
