# What Does It Look Like to Show Our Work?

## Remember: Retrieve an Idea Exactly When It’s Needed

You don’t need to invent a new theory or write the next great novel to derive value from your Second Brain.
Within days of capturing ideas that resonate with you, you’ll start to notice opportunities to share them with others to their benefit.

## Connect: Use Notes to Tell a Bigger Story

Creative expression isn’t always about self-promotion or advancing our own career.
Some of our most beautiful, creative acts are ones in which we connect the dots for others in ways they wouldn’t be able to do themselves.

## Create: Complete Projects and Accomplish Goals Stress- Free

Whatever you are responsible for creating—whether it is documents or presentations or decisions or outcomes, your Second Brain is a vital repository of all the bits and pieces you’ll want in front of you when you sit down to focus.
It is a creative environment you can step into at any time, in any place, when it’s time to make things happen.
