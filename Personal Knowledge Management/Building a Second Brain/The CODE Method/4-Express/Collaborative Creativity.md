A common myth of creativity is that of the solitary artist, working in total isolation.

Reframing your work in terms of Intermediate Packets isn’t just about doing the same old stuff in smaller chunks.
That doesn’t unlock your true potential. The transformation comes from the fact that smaller chunks are inherently more shareable and collaborative.

It’s less confronting to hear criticism on one small aspect of your work, at an early stage when you still have time to correct it, than getting a negative reaction after months of effort.

You can use each little piece of intermediate feedback to refine what you’re making, to make it more focused, more appealing, more succinct, or easier to understand.

**Once you understand how incredibly valuable feedback is, you start to crave as much of it as you can find.**

**It is by sharing our ideas with other people that we discover which ones represent our most valuable expertise.**
