Everything in a kitchen is designed and organized to support an outcome— preparing a meal as eciently as possible.

- The archives are like the freezer— items are in cold storage until they are needed, which could be far into the future.
- Resources are like the pantry—available for use in any meal you make, but neatly tucked away out of sight in the meantime.
- Areas are like the fridge— items that you plan on using relatively soon, and that you want to check on more frequently.
- Projects are like the pots and pans cooking on the stove—the items you are actively preparing right now. Each kind of food is organized according to how accessible it needs to be for you to make the meals you want to eat.

Imagine how absurd it would be to organize a kitchen instead by kind of food: fresh fruit, dried fruit, fruit juice, and frozen fruit would all be stored in the same place, just because they all happen to be made of fruit.

This is exactly the way most people organize their les and notes—keeping all their book notes together just because they happen to come from books.

Instead of organizing ideas according to where they come from, I recommend organizing them according to where they are going—specically, the outcomes that they can help you realize.

The true test of whether a piece of knowledge is valuable is not whether it is perfectly organized and neatly labeled, but whether it can have an impact on someone or something that matters to you.
