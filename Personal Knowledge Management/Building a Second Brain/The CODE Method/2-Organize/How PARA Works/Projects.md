## What I’m Working on Right Now

Short-term efforts in your work or life that you’re working on now.

Projects have a couple of features that make them an ideal way to organize modern work: 
- First, they have a beginning and an end, they take place during a specic period of time and then they finish.
- Second, they have a specic, clear outcome that needs to happen in order for them to be checked off as complete, such as “finalize,” “green-light,” “launch,” or “publish.”

**Knowing which projects you’re currently committed to is crucial to being able to prioritize your week, plan your progress, and say no to things that aren’t important.**
