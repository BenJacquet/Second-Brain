The temptation when initially capturing notes is to also try to decide where they should go and what they mean.

Here’s the problem: the moment you first capture an idea is the worst time to try to decide what it relates to.

First, because you’ve just encountered it and haven’t had any time to ponder its ultimate purpose.

More importantly, because forcing yourself to make decisions every time you capture something adds a lot of friction to the process.

It is better put take notes in a "daily box" and decide how to organize at a later time.

Once you’ve captured a batch of notes and it’s time to organize them, PARA comes into play.

The four main categories are ordered by actionability to make the decision of where to put notes as easy as possible:

- Projects are most actionable because you’re working on them right now and with a concrete deadline in mind.
- Areas have a longer time horizon and are less immediately actionable.
- Resources may become actionable depending on the situation.
- Archives remain inactive unless they are needed.

This order gives us a convenient checklist for deciding where to put a note, starting at the top of the list and moving down:

1. In which **project** will this be most useful?  
2. If none: In which **area** will this be most useful?
3. If none: Which **resource** does this belong to?
4. If none: Place in **archives**.
