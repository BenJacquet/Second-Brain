## What I’m Committed to Over Time

Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time.

For example, the area of our lives called “Finances” doesn’t have a definite end date.
It’s something that we will have to think about and manage, in one way or another, for as long as we live. It doesn’t have a final objective, that makes it an **area**.

Even though areas have no final outcome, it is still important to manage them.
