## Things I’ve Completed or Put on Hold

Inactive items from the other three categories.

This includes any item from the previous three categories that is no longer active.

The archives are an important part of PARA because they allow you to place a folder in “cold storage” so that it doesn’t clutter your workspace, while safekeeping it forever just in case you need it.

**Unlike with your house or garage, there is no penalty for keeping digital stuff forever**

### Example:
- Projects that are completed or canceled
- Areas of responsibility that you are no longer committed to maintaining
	- When a relationship ends
	- Your previous home after moving out
- Resources that are no longer relevant:
	- Hobbies you lose interest in
	- Subjects you no longer care about
