## Introduction

Information isn’t a luxury—it is the very basis of our survival.

Just as with the food we put into our bodies, it is our responsibility and right to choose our information diet.

It’s up to us to decide what information is good for us, what we want more of and less of, and ultimately, what we do with it.

**You are what you consume, and that applies just as much to information as to nutrition.**

Your Second Brain is your “knowledge garden” where you are free to cultivate your ideas and develop your own thinking away from the deafening noise of other people’s opinions.

Start by seeding our itwith only the most interesting, insightful, useful idea.

## Building a Private Collection of Knowledge

Revisit the items you’ve previously saved to read later, many of them that seemed so important at the time are clearly trivial and unneeded.

### External knowledge could include:

- **Highlights**: Insightful passages from books or articles you read.
- **Quotes**: Memorable passages from podcasts or audiobooks you listen to.
- **Bookmarks** **and** **favorites**: Links to interesting content you nd on the web or favorited social media posts.
- **Voice** **memos**: Clips recorded on your mobile device as “notes to self.”
- **Meeting** **notes**: Notes you take about what was discussed during meetings or phone calls.  
- **Images**: Photos or other images that you nd inspiring or interesting.
- **Takeaways**: Lessons from courses, conferences, or presentations you’ve attended.

### Internal knowledge could include:

- **Stories**: Your favorite anecdotes, whether they happened to you or someone else.
- **Insights**: The small (and big) realizations you have.
- **Memories**: Experiences from your life that you don’t want to forget.
- **Reflections**: Personal thoughts and lessons written in a journal or diary.
- **Musings**: Random “shower ideas” that pop into your head.

### What Not to Keep

- Sensitive Information
- Data better handled by another support
- Very large files
- Collaborative data

### Twelve Favorite Problems

Keep 12 **open ended** questions in a dormant state at every moment.

Confront every new knowledge you gain to them and see if you get a breakthrough.

The power of your favorite problems is that they tend to stay fairly consistent over time.

Use your list of favorite problems to make decisions about what to capture: anything potentially relevant to answering them.

## Capture Criteria: How to Avoid Keeping Too Much (or Too Little)

The best curators are picky about what they allow into their collections, and you should be too.

If you try to save every piece of material you come across, you run the risk of inundating your future self with tons of irrelevant information.

**At that point, your Second Brain will be no better than scrolling through social media.**

To decide if an information is worth storing, ask yourself these questions:
- Does It Inspire Me?
- Is It Useful?
- Is It Personal?
- Is It Surprising?

Our intuitive mind learns, and responds, even without our conscious awareness.

If you ignore that inner voice of intuition, over time it will slowly quiet down and fade away.

If you practice listening to what it is telling you, the inner voice will grow stronger.
