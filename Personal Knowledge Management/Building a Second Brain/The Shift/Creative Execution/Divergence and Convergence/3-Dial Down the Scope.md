# Ship Something Small and Concrete

When the full complexity of a project starts to reveal itself, most people choose to delay it.
We tell ourselves we just need more time, but the delay ends up creating more problems than it solves.

The problem isn’t a lack of time. It is that we forget that we have control over the scope of the project. We can “dial it down” to a more manageable size, and we must if we ever want to see it finished.

**You can’t wait until everything is perfect.**

By dropping or reducing or postponing the least important parts, we can unblock ourselves and move forward even when time is scarce.

How can you know which direction to take your thinking without feedback from customers, colleagues, collaborators, or friends?
And how can you collect that feedback without showing them something concrete?

This is the chicken-and-egg problem of creativity: you don’t know what you should create, but you can’t discover what people want until you create something.

**Dialing Down the Scope is a way of short-circuiting that paradox and testing the waters with something small and concrete, while still protecting the fragile and tentative edges of your work.**
