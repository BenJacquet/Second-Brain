# Give Yourself Stepping-Stones

This technique is valuable any time you are starting a new piece of work.
It gives you a way to plan your progress even when performing tasks that are inherently unpredictable.

The Archipelago of Ideas technique is a contemporary reinvention of the age-old practice of outlining, laying out the points you want to include up front, so that when it comes time to execute all you have to do is string them together.

To create an **Archipelago of Ideas**, you divergently gather a group of ideas, sources, or points that will form the backbone of your essay, presentation, or deliverable.
Once you have a critical mass of ideas to work with, you switch decisively into convergence mode and link them together in an order that makes sense.

This process separates the two activities your brain has the most dificulty performing at the same time:
- Choosing ideas (known as **selection**).
- Arranging them into a logical flow (known as **sequencing**).

Selection is **divergent**, requiring an open state of mind that is willing to consider any possibility.

Sequencing is **convergent**, requiring a more closed state of mind focused only on the material you already have in front of you.

**Instead of starting with scarcity, start with abundance, the abundance of interesting insights youâ€™ve collected in your Second Brain.**
