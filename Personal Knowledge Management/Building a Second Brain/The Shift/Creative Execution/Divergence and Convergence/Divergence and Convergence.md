If you look at the process of creating anything, it follows the same simple pattern, alternating back and forth between divergence and convergence.

A creative endeavor begins with an act of divergence. You open the space of possibilities and **consider as many options as possible**.

Convergence forces us to eliminate options, make trade-offs, and decide what is truly essential.
It is about **narrowing the range of possibilities** so that you can make forward progress and end up with a final result you are proud of.

Convergence allows our work to take on a life of its own and become something separate from ourselves.

The model of divergence and convergence is so fundamental to all creative work, we can see it present in any creative field.

If we overlay the four steps of CODE onto the model of divergence and convergence, we arrive at a powerful template for the creative process in our time.

There are three powerful strategies for completing creative projects I recommend to help you through the pitfalls of convergence.
Each of them depends on having a Second Brain where you can manipulate and shape information without worrying it will disappear.
Think of them as the tools in your Second Brain tool belt, which you can turn to anytime you need to get unstuck, find your way around obstacles, or decide what to do next:
