# Use Yesterday’s Momentum Today

You can think of a Hemingway Bridge as a bridge between the islands in your Archipelago of Ideas. You may have the islands, but that is just the first step.
The much more challenging work is linking them together into something that makes sense.

The Hemingway Bridge is a way of making each creative leap from one island to the next less dramatic and risky: you keep some energy and imagination in reserve and use it as a launchpad for the next step in your progress.

## How do you create a Hemingway Bridge?

Instead of burning through every last ounce of energy at the end of a work session, reserve the last few minutes to write down some of the following kinds of things in your digital notes:

### Write down ideas for next steps:
At the end of a work session, write down what you think the next steps could be for the next one.

### Write down the current status:
This could include your current biggest challenge, most important open question, or future roadblocks you expect.

### Write down any details you have in mind that are likely to be forgotten once you step away:
Such as details about the characters in your story, the pitfalls of the event you’re planning, or the subtle considerations of the product you’re designing.

### Write out your intention for the next work session:
Set an intention for what you plan on tackling next, the problem you intend to solve, or a certain milestone you want to reach.
