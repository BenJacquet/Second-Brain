[[Divergence and Convergence]]

> Creative products are always shiny and new; the creative process is ancient and unchanging
\—Silvano Arieti, psychiatrist and author of Creativity: The Magic Synthesis

By the time you sit down to make progress on something, all the work to gather and organize the source material needs to already be done.
We can’t expect ourselves to instantly come up with brilliant ideas on demand.

Innovation and problem-solving depend on a routine that systematically brings interesting ideas to the surface of our awareness.

The products of creativity are constantly changing and there is always a new “hot” trend to run after. One year it’s Instagram photos, the next it’s Snapchat stories, the next it’s TikTok videos, and so on forever. Even the long tradition of the novel has evolved for each era.

But if you go one level deeper, to the process of creativity, it is a very different story. The creative process is ancient and unchanging. It was the same thousands of years ago as it is today.

One of the most important patterns that underlies the creative process is called “divergence and convergence.”
