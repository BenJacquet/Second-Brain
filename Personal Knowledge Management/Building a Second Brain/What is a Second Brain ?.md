### What Is a Second Brain?

The practice of writing down one’s thoughts and notes to help make sense of the world has a long legacy. For centuries, artists and intellectuals from **Leonardo da Vinci** to **Virginia Woolf**, from **John Locke** to **Octavia Butler**, have recorded the ideas they found most interesting in a book they carried around with them, known as a “**commonplace book**.”

**Commonplace books** were a portal through which educated people interacted with the world. They drew on their notebooks in conversation and used them to connect bits of knowledge from dierent sources and to inspire their own thinking.

Resurrecting the **commonplace book** allows us to stem the tide, shifting our relationship with information toward the timeless and the private.

Instead of consuming ever-greater amounts of content, we could take on a more patient, thoughtful approach that favors rereading, reformulating, and working through the implications of ideas over time.
Not only could this lead to more civil discussions about the important topics of the day
It could also preserve our mental health and heal our splintered attention.

Once our notes and observations become digital, they can be **searched**, **organized** and **synced** across all our devices, and backed up to the cloud for safekeeping.

So many of us share the feeling that we are surrounded by knowledge, yet starving for wisdom. That despite all the mind-expanding ideas we have access to, the quality of our attention is only getting worse. That we are paralyzed by the conict between our responsibilities and our most heartfelt passions, so that we’re never quite able to focus and also never quite able to rest.
