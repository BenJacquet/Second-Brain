## Difference between information and knowledge

**Information** serves as input for decision-making and actions, which requires the capability of selection, sensemaking and interpretation.

From this perspective, **knowledge** is the result of information processed by the conscious mind. While **information** is organised data, **knowledge** refers to the tacit or explicit understanding about relationships among phenomena.

Knowledge is embedded in believes and behaviours, a large part of it is tacit.
The value of knowledge becomes evident only if the “know-what” is converted into “know-how” which manifests as actions.

This capacity to make an appropriate choice of actions depends upon a wide repertoire of action potentials which is based on experiences and expertise developed over time.

**The problem is that we view competence as an event, rather than asset.**
