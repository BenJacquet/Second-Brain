Let's make an analogy:

There are two people, Joey and Ross, that take on a challenge:
They need to dismantle a very large lego construct to rebuild it to some other place later.
They are not allowed to take pictures of it.

You can choose to dismantle it yourself or just have someone else do it for you.

Joey choses the second option, he asks the pieces to be delivered to the place where he needs to rebuild the construct.
But once he tries to assemble everything, he realizes he does not know how all the pieces fit together.

Ross on the other hand decided to dismantle everything himself, giving him context and most importantly, a big picture of how every piece connects.

Who do you think managed to rebuild it the most accurately and effectively?
