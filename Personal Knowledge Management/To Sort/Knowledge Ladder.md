## From Data to Information

Increasingly high-performance data analytics (HPDA) enables the acquisition and analysis of huge volumes of data and its subsequent transformation into information as a basis for actionable insights.
Algorithms such as neural networks are able to interpret sensory data, recognise patterns, cluster and classify enormous amounts of data (e.g. face recognition of thousands of people).

Such systems create **actionable information**.

## From Knowledge to Competence

- Interaction between humans and machines
- Work without borders
- Crowdworking
- Self-Management as a core competence
- Digital Leadership

## From Competence to Competitiveness

The ultimate objective is to create unique customer value based on the capabilities of an organization.

Unique knowledge in the form of a superior proprietary technology can lead to long-term market dominance.


### Dynamic Capabilities and (Digital) Platform Lifecycles

Reflect on the four-stages: Birth, Expansion, Leadership, and Self-Renewalâ€”of the platform lifecycle.

When platform renewal is called for, the emphasis returns to sensing future possibilities and generating new ideas for a platform and business model, developing them alongside the existing business, and eventually undertaking a major transformation to restart the platform lifecycle.

Dynamic capabilities are necessary in turbulent and disruptive environments:
- Sensing capability:
	- Receptiveness to weak signals
	- Constant gathering of informations (business, market, trends, needs)
	- Interpretation with available knowledge
	- Draw conclusions
- Learning capability:
	- Integrate quick learning loops into daily operations and business development
- Integration capability:
	- Overall sense-making
	- Building of a shared understanding among the organization
	- Sharing tacit knowledge
	- Combining individual knowledge into new operational processes and practices of a team
- Coordination capability:
	- Orchestrating individual tasks and activities
	- Maintaining an attitude that accepts change
	- Establishing monitoring systems
	- Ensuring the availability of financial and human resources
