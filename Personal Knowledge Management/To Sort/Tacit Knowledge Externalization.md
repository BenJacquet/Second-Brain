## What is it ?
Tacit knowledge is all the information that a person managed to accumulate thanks to experience, context, practice and personal reflexion.

Two dimensions of tacit knowledge can be differentiated:
- The cognitive, which consists of mental models, schemata, beliefs, and values deeply engrained in the human mind.
- The technical, which embodies the types of crafts or individual skills commonly called know-how.

Such knowledge held by employees must be passed along to other organizational members to increase organizational performance and ultimately develop competitive advantage.

## Why is it important ?

Imagine you're given all the ingredients to make the best dish ever, if you are not a chef and lack the necessary experience you will not be able to produce it.
