## Responsibilities

### 1 - Team Facilitator
A great tech lead thinks ahead, anticipates risks, and addresses them before they become a bottleneck for the team.

They minimize the translation layer by bringing business terms into the development team and encouraging their use, to foster understanding and empathy with business stakeholders.

### 2 - Team Debugger
A variety of blockers can impede a development team from meeting its deliverables (e.g. poor task management, unclear requirements, complex development process, etc).

Similarly to how doctors might monitor a person’s white blood cell count to determine the existence of an infection, there are metrics he can use to monitor the team health on a regular basis.

### 3 - Technical Debt Management
A great Tech Lead manages the technical debt in effective ways to ensure it doesn’t accumulate to the point where the only thing the team is doing is servicing debt and not iterating on the product.

If you don’t measure technical debt, you don’t know how big it is and how fast it is growing.

Make technical debt payments continuously, ideally, it you should spend 20% of your effort on that.

###  4 - Task Manager
One of the most critical requirements of a good software development team is consistent velocity, and ability to deliver on its estimates.

Here are some essential actions a Tech Lead should take:
- **Groom the backlog daily**. Look for how to break down larger tasks into smaller ones. Look for dependencies where one task is dependent on another.
- Do not start development on a task unless it has been broken down to the lowest possible complexity.
- Break down tasks based on how complex they are to the developers on your team, and not how complex they are to you as a Tech Lead.
- Check on the status of a task whenever the task feels ‘_stale_’ (e.g. it’s been started for more than a day).
- Ensure the backlog always has enough work for at least 1 to 2 iterations out.
