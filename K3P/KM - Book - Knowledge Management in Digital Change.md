## Chapter 7 : IT Support for Knowledge Processes in Digital Social Collaboration

### Codification and Personalization

The authors propose that there are two main ways to think about knowledge:
- As something you possess, like a possession.
- As something you do, like a practice.

Based on this, they suggest that organizations can use two different strategies for managing knowledge:
- **Codification**, which involves storing knowledge in repositories.
- **Personalization**, which involves connecting people with others who have relevant knowledge or expertise.

To put it more simply, this chapter discusses two types of technology systems that organizations can use to manage knowledge.

Some systems help store knowledge in one central place, while others help connect people with the right knowledge or expertise. These systems can help promote knowledge sharing and collaboration within organizations.

**It's like having a library where you can store books (codification) or a network of people who can answer your questions (personalization).**


### The importance of context

According to the "knowledge ladder," to go from information to knowledge, you need to add context, experience, and expectations.

Context is essential, not just for humans, but also for computers that are used to support knowledge processes. The computer needs to be able to understand the context of what the knowledge worker is doing in order to provide useful support.

It can be derived from a variety of sources, including social networks, documents, and business process management systems.

### Four types of solution

**ACM (Adaptive Case Management):**
It is an approach to managing business processes that emphasizes flexibility, transparency, and continuous improvement. Unlike traditional Business Process Management (BPM) systems that rely on strict task sequences and workflows, ACM systems allow for more variation and adaptability in handling knowledge-intensive, weakly structured processes. ACM systems also focus on the link between content and people, making it easier to bridge the gap between codification and personalization.

**KM (Knowledge Management):**
It is a process of creating, sharing, using, and managing the knowledge and information of an organization. KM systems are designed to help organizations create, capture, store, and share knowledge and expertise. The goal is to improve productivity, collaboration, and innovation by making information and expertise easily accessible to employees.

**BPM (Business Process Management):**
It is a management approach that seeks to improve organizational efficiency and effectiveness by identifying, analyzing, and improving business processes. BPM systems use workflows and process modeling to automate, manage, and optimize business processes, with the goal of increasing productivity, reducing costs, and improving customer satisfaction.

**CSCW (Computer Supported Collaborative Work):**
It is an interdisciplinary research field that studies how people use technology to work together in groups. CSCW systems are designed to support collaboration and communication among geographically dispersed teams, enabling them to share information and knowledge, coordinate activities, and work together more effectively. CSCW systems often include features such as instant messaging, video conferencing, and document sharing.

To summerize, a modern collaboration solution for the digital enterprise should use social software, (lightweight) semantic technologies, natural language processing, machine learning and conversational user interfaces to flexibly support business and knowledge processes as well as projects in an ACM manner. Despite these modern trends, document management is still an important foundation and not obsolete. Instead of building single monolithic information systems with enormous complexity, the integration of smaller, easy to understand building blocks should be pursued.
