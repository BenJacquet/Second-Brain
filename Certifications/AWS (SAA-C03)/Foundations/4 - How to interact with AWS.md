Instead of physically managing infrastructure, you logically manage it, through the AWS Application Programming Interface (AWS API).
When you create, delete, or change any AWS resource, you will use API calls to AWS to do that.

### You can make these API calls in several ways:
- The [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/getting-started-with-aws-management-console/)
- The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)
- IDE and IDE toolkits
- AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs)
